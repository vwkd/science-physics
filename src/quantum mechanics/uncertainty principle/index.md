# Uncertainty principle



## Introduction

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is not a weird Postulate of QM. It is a natural consequence from the trade-off how concentrated a wave and its frequency representation can be. Assuming the results from QM that matter is some kind of wave and that the momentum depends on the frequency of the wave, the uncertainty principle follows naturally.

A signal which is concentrated in time must have a spread out Fourier transform. This means it correlates with a wide range of frequencies. Conversely, a signal with a concentrated Fourier transform has to be spread out in time.

A fundamental result of QM is that a particle has a wave associated with it that determines its position (?). Another result is that the momentum is proportional to the spatial frequency of that wave (p=hξ).
But since the Fourier transform of the wave gives the spatial frequency the uncertainty principle necessarily follows from what we discovered above. If the wave is concentrated around a single point, i.e. the position is known precisely, the Fourier transform is spread out, i.e. the wave describing the momentum is spread out.

Now what we can measure is the probability and not the wave associated with the particle. But the probability of finding the particle in a given region is proportional to the wave in that region (precisely probability prop. intensity prop. magnitude of amplitude squared). So the uncertainty principle isn’t due to some fundamental randomness in the universe, but due to the well determined trade off between the concentration of the wave and it’s frequency representation.

ToDo: Figure out what wave looks like, is it over time or space axis?

For a fixed point in time t, a particle has a spatial wave ψ(x) associated with it and the probability of finding it at a position x is proportional to the intensity of the wave at that point |ψ(x)|^2. The spatial frequency of the wave is just the Fourier transform of the wave ξ(k)=ψ^(k).
