# Introduction



## 

a system is described by a wave function
obeys Schroedinger equation, tells how evolves in time, similar to Newton's second law for classical system
but when looks behaves as a particle

explains that when looks wave function collapses to unknown point, only knows probability
Einstein and Scroedinger didn't like that idea, Schroedinger invented the absurd idea of Schroedinger's Cat for exactly that reason, before looks cat is in both states at same time, beware: don't confuse with doesn't know state, but actually is state

actually problem is that observer is treated classical, not as if is wave function
but observer is similarly made up of atoms, similarly quantum mechanic system, similarly entangled with observed quantum system

reality *is* the wave function, not just a tool to describe it
there is no collapse of the wave function
universe splits

what you experience as reality is just one version of the multiverse

entaglement of two distant particles not because can communicate faster than light, but because there aren't two wave functions but only one
there is just one big wave function, the wave function of the universe

quantum mechanics replaces classical mechanics, classical mechanics is an approximation in certain limits


## Quantum Field Theory

space is a field
particle is just a location where field vibrates more, higher energy state
there is no "empty" space, fields are there, just in their lowest energy mode, there *is* something

proposal: the more entagled two systems, the closer their distance is
