## Quantum Field Theory



## Introduction

field: fluid like substance that can ripple
universe is made up of fields
fields are the fundamental building blocks of the universe
there is no "empty" space, fields are there, just in their lowest energy state, there *is* something

Faraday postulated electromagnetic field
electromagnetic field was one of the most abstract theories
photons (light) is just a wave of the EM field

this holds more generally for all particles
particle is a wave in its field, location where field vibrates more, higher energy state
wave is like a bundle of energy, descrete size because of descrete energy
particle is a wave, not a particle, there is no particle-wave duality

fields can interact with each other
force is just another field
universe is harmoneous dance of the fields that interact with each other
solves problem of "action at a distance" of classical mechanics, no non-local interaction through magical forces

Standard Model
12 fields that give rise to matter
4 fields that give the forces
    field associated to gravity is spacetime itself
1 field that gives mass
    field associated to mass is higgs field

electric charge of a particle is statement about how the particle's field interacts with the electromagnetic field 
mass of a particle is statement about how the particle's field interacts with the higgs field
