## Quantum Field Theory



## Introduction

field: fluid like substance that can ripple
universe is made up of fields
fields are the fundamental building blocks of the universe
there is no "empty" space, fields are there, just in their lowest energy state, there *is* something

Faraday postulated electromagnetic field
electromagnetic field was one of the most abstract theories
photons (light) is just a wave of the EM field

this holds more generally for all particles
particle is a wave in its field, location where field vibrates more, higher energy state
wave is like a bundle of energy, descrete size because of descrete energy
particle is a wave, not a particle, there is no particle-wave duality

fields can interact with each other
force is just another field
universe is harmoneous dance of the fields that interact with each other
solves problem of "action at a distance" of classical mechanics, no non-local interaction through magical forces

Standard Model of Particle Physics
12 fields that give matter, fermions
    field has only two values, zero and x, on and off
        in particle analogy, particle takes up space
    quarks: fermions that feel a strong force
    leptons: fermions that don't feel a strong force
4 fields that give forces, bosons
    field associated to gravity is spacetime itself, graviton
    field can have arbitrary value
        in particle analogy, particle doesn't take up space
    gauge boson: boson that carries force
    gluons carry strong force
1 field that gives mass, boson
    field associated to mass is higgs field
    special, because non-zero in empty space (lowest energy state), unlike other fields
is complete for ordinary matter (but not the entire universe, dark matter)

electric charge of a particle is statement about how the particle's field interacts with the electromagnetic field 
mass of a particle is statement about how the particle's field interacts with the higgs field 

it's wrong to ask where *is* the particle, the only thing that *is* is the wave, and it's everywhere
even atoms aren't mostly empty space, they are filled with waves

Particle Properties
mass
spin: abstract property, not actually rotational spin of non-zero sized object since can be zero, named because determines rotational spin of a collection of particles into their collective angular momentum
interactions: can interact with certain kinds of other particles

atoms are not the fundamental particles, wrongly named by early chemists when they didn't know better

radioactivity: one nucleus of an atom can convert into another one

antimatter: particles with some conserved quantity have an antiparticle whose same quantity has the opposite value, not every particle has an antiparticle

family / generations of particles, are just heavier
