# Quantum Gravity


## Introduction

matter and energy curves spacetime 
gravity is curvature of spacetime

quantizing classical model of general relativity didn't work

spacetime is a field

entaglement is related to geometry of spacetime (since field fills spacetime), the closer two regions of the field, the more entagled they are, two waves in water interact with each other more if they are closer to each other

entaglement is related to geometry of spacetime
    the more entagled two systems the closer their distance
entaglement is related to energy of a region
    "empty" space is entagled, if wants to put particle there needs to break entaglement by putting in energy
out pops general relativity
