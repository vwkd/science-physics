# Introduction



## Introduction

works incredible well to predict things
but nobody understands what's really going on

a system is described by a wave (function)
can be in certain discrete harmonics
obeys Schroedinger equation, tells how evolves in time, similar to Newton's second law for classical system
deterministic, not probabilistic
superposition, in two states at the same time
beware: don't confuse with doesn't *know* state, but actually *is* state

but seems to mismatch what observer sees, observer sees particles
invents collapse of wave function when observes
wave suddenly and unpredictably collapses to a point, and probability associated with each point
measurement does something to particle, changes it
Einstein and Scroedinger didn't like that idea
Schroedinger invented the absurd idea of Schroedinger's Cat for exactly that reason, before looks cat (some macroscopic system) is in both states at same time, after looks cat snaps into one of the two states, ridicoulous

collapse invention is wrong, because "observe" isn't clearly defined, and not if the particle *is* a wave or an particle

problem only if observer is treated classical
but observer is similarly made up of atoms, similarly quantum mechanic system, similarly entangled with observed quantum system
doesn't dillute quantum mechanics to make it more classical

reality *is* the wave function, not just a tool to describe it
there is no collapse of the wave function
observers is quantum system, gets entagled with observed quantum system
observer doesn't "feel" like he's in a superposition, because there are now two of him
universe splits into multiverse, each copy of observer experiences only the one version he's in
<!-- note: own interpretation below, Sean Carroll thinks probability that "me" ends up in a branch is given by same probability as before, but I say that both branches are "me", just evolve differently  -->
there is no probability, just different observers in different branches, both think they're the only branch

entaglement of two distant particles not because can communicate faster than light, no "spooky action at a distance", but because there aren't two wave functions but only one
there is just one big wave function, the wave function of the universe

quantum mechanics replaces classical mechanics, classical mechanics is an approximation in certain limits
nature is quantum, needs to derive classical, not other way around quantise classical
