# Entropy



## Microstate / Microscopic world

- reversible evolution
- no directionality of time
- fundamental laws of physics don't have directionality of time
- directionality of time not inherent to nature of reality
- information is conserved
- ? can compute the past state



## Macrostate / Macroscopic world

- irreversible evolution
- has directionality of time
- asymmetry of time, past is different from future, e.g. did experience past but not future, etc.
- information is not conserved
- ? can't compute the past state, e.g. broken egg
- where does directionality of time come from?



## Entropy

- number of different possible microstates corresponding to same macrostate￼
- number of indistinguishable arrangements of system
- number of ways can rearrange constituents of system so that humans don't notice
- measure for randomness of system
- beware: the term disorder is confusing, see complexity ❗️



## Evolution


- microstates fluctuates randomly over time
- all microstates are equally likely, but macrostates aren't equally likely
- more ways to have macrostate with high number of microstates than with low number of microstates
- system evolves towards the macrostate with the greatest number of microstates
- higher probability for system to evolve into high entropy than low entropy
- entropy increases over time in a closed system, second law of thermodynamics
- beware: can decrease entropy locally by increasing it more elsewhere, e.g. cold fridge ❗️
- eventually heat death of universe



## Directionality of Time

- current universe not at highest entropy yet
- universe started in low entropy at Big Bang, initial condition
- unclear why, maybe due to infinite time has fluctuation to lower entropy from higher entropy, any configuration eventually happens
- evolution of entropy gives rise to directionality of time in macroscopic world
- directionality of time emergent property
- due to timely vicinity to Big Bang event
- just like directionality of space due to spatial vicinity to massive object due to gravity
- no directionality of time anymore when reaches highest entropy state
- directionality of time not universal, not from laws of physics themselves



## Complexity

- how can arise, e.g. life on earth?
- due to increasing entropy, transition from simple low entropy to simple high entropy state, e.g. mixing coffee and cream, before simple, after simple, in between complex swirling
- transition is many locally low entropy and high entropy states, creates differences, variability, multitude
- temporary phenomenon of evolution of entropy, peaks in middle between low and high entropy
- existence of life only because of rising entropy, not a struggle against entropy
- life is solution to satisfy law of increasing entropy
- highest complexity when stars stop shining




## Energy

- energy is not used, always stays constant
- energy is just converted from a useful low entropy form to a useless high entropy form
- e.g. sun rays is energy in low entropy form, earth radiates heat of same energy in high entropy form, food is low entropy, etc.
- the use comes from the difference in entropy, not energy itself
- energy is like a medium, always present, e.g. water
- entropy is what does the useful "work", e.g. water wave
