# Entropy



## Microstate / Microscopic world

- reversible evolution
- no directionality of time
- microscopic laws of physics don't have directionality of time built-in
- information is conserved
- ? can compute the past state



## Macrostate / Macroscopic world

- irreversible evolution
- macroscopic laws of physics have directionality of time built-in
- has directionality of time
- asymmetry of time, past is different from future, e.g. did experience past but not future, etc.
- information is not conserved
- ? can't compute the past state, e.g. broken egg
- where does directionality of time come from?



## Entropy

- number of microstates for same macrostate
- number of different microstates corresponding to same macrostate￼
- number of ways we can rearrange constituents of system so that we don't notice
- number of indistinguishable arrangements of system
- beware: disorder is confusing, see complexity ❗️



## Evolution

- microstates fluctuates randomly over time
- all microstates equally likely
- more ways to be high entropy than low entropy
- higher probability to evolve into high entropy macrostate than low entropy
- all macrostates aren't equally likely
- entropy increases over time in a closed system, second law of thermodynamics
- beware: can decrease entropy locally by increasing it more elsewhere, e.g. cold fridge ❗️



## Directionality of Time

- universe started in low entropy at Big Bang, initial condition
- unclear why, maybe because fluctuation to lower entropy from higher entropy due to infinite time, any configuration eventually happens
- evolution of entropy gives rise to directionality of time in macroscopic world
- directionality of time emergent property of influential Big Bang event in timely vicinity, no directionality of time anymore when reaches highest entropy state



## Complexity

- e.g. life on earth
- how can arise?
- due to increasing entropy, transition from simple low entropy to simple high entropy state, e.g. mixing coffee and cream, before simple, after simple, in between complex swirling
- transition is many locally low entropy and high entropy states, creates differences, variability, multitude
- temporary phenomenon of evolution, peaks in middle between low and high entropy
- existence of life because of rising entropy



## Energy

- energy is not used, always stays constant
- energy is just converted from a useful low entropy form to a useless high entropy form
- e.g. sun radiates energy in low entropy form, earth converts it to high entropy form, radiates it away again
- the use comes from the difference in entropy, not energy itself
- energy is like a medium, always present, e.g. water
- entropy is what does the useful "work", e.g. water wave
