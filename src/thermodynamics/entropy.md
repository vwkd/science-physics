# Entropy



## Microstate

- evolution is reversible
- no directionality of time
- reversible
- can compute the past state
- information is conserved
- microscopic laws of physics don't have directionality of time built-in
- no directionality of time in microscopic world



## Macrostate

- evolution is not reversible
- directionality of time
- irreversible
- can't compute the past state
- information is not conserved
- macroscopic laws of physics have directionality of time built-in
- directionality of time in macroscopic world
- asymmetry of time, past is different from future, e.g. can remember past (not future), etc.
- also called arrow of time
- where does come from?



## Entropy

- number of microstates for same macrostate
- number of ways we can rearrange constituents of system so that we don't notice
- number of indistinguishable arrangements of system
- number of different microstates corresponding to same macrostate￼
- how spread out is energy, how not clumped up
- beware:  not necessarily disorder, e.g. complexity of life on earth is due to increasing entropy ❗️



## Evolution

- microstates fluctuates randomly over time
- all microstates equally likely
- more ways to be high entropy than low entropy
- higher probability to evolve into high entropy state than low entropy
- entropy increases over time in a closed system
- beware: can decrease entropy locally by decreasing it elsewhere ❗️
- second law of thermodynamics
- all macrostates aren't equally likely


- unclear why universe started in low entropy
- maybe because infinite time fluctuates from highest possible entropy to any lower entropy, any configuration happens

- gives rise to directionality of time
- because initial condition of Big Bang that started with low entropy
- directionality of time not built into universe, emergent property of influential event big bang in vicinity
- question: why was Big Bang very low entropy?


- locally low entropy, complexity, e.g. earth
- how can complexity arise?
- complexity naturally arises on transition from simple low to simple high entropy, e.g. mixing coffee and cream
- complexity is temporary phenomenon of evolution, peaks in middle between low and high entropy
- existence of life because of rising entropy
- sun gives energy in low entropy form, earth converts it to energy in high entropy form
