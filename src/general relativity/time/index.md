# Introduction



## 1

clock: object that repeats itself in a predictable way
living beings can experience time because they have clocks in them, e.g. heart beat, breath, etc.

mystery is why time only moves forward, unlike how we experience directions in space

continuity: space “happens” over and over again, not just once and that’s it, only slightly different from before, not completely reordered universe, like movie frames

progress: moments are ordered, past and future, experiences time even though only ever is at one single present moment, e.g. breath in and out

directionality of space is not universal, depends on gravity
directionality of time seems universal, but stems from big bang, not from laws of physics themselves, just like with space

fundamental laws of physics do not have an arrow of time

second law of thermodynamics: as time passes, entropy (disorderliness) increases, this creates the arrow of time, e.g. ice cube melts
because more ways to be disordered than be ordered, since each state has equal probability of happening disorder is more likely to happen, entropy increases 

big bang started with low entropy, nobody knows why
yesterday had lower entropy than today, by induction back to big bang

low entropy in the beginning and ever increasing entropy gives rise to arrow of time
no arrow of time in fundamental laws of physics, not inherent in the nature of reality
arrow of space because lives near planet
arrow of time because lives in aftermath of big bang

complexity only increases in between low entropy and high entropy, e.g. milk mixing in coffe



## 2

points in space seem all real, while points in time only the present moment seems real

presentism: only present moment in time is real, others are illusions
eternalism: all moments in time are real, four dimensional spacetime, just experiences only one, that one calls present

Q: Wouldn’t eternalism imply that the future is determined? Hence no free will, only observer, etc. Would actually support buddhism, since shows that attachment to perceptions is pointless if they're predetermined anyways, can only observe
