# Time



- one dimension of spacetime
- very special for humans, unlike remaining three spatial dimensions of four dimensional spacetime
- current position calls present, behind calls past, ahead calls future
- can only see / perceive / experience present, can't see past or future, unlike can see all of space
- only present seems real, past and future seem illusion
- presentism believe this, eternalism is physical view
- can't move through time, unlike can move through space
- but is moved through time, if wants to or not, involuntarily
- is moved in same direction to future, can't turn around to past
- is moved with constant speed from own perspective
- speed of others through time can appear different, see Special Relativity
- eternalism implies future is determined, perceptions are predetermined, no free will, is only observer, like watching a movie
- supports buddhism, attachment to perceptions is pointless
