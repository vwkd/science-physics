# Cause and Effect



## Microscopic world

- not fundamental, in microscopic world just sequence, pattern




- in quantum mechanics (and previously classical mechanics) given current state, can compute future, but can also compute past

- determinism, no free will
- future is not different from past

- at every point in time can compute all further and previous points in time
- like a sequence of integers, 3 is not caused by 2 and is not the cause for 4, it's just a pattern

- laws of physics are the pattern
- there is no cause and effect

- on scale of atoms no such thing a choice, free will, cause and effect



## Macroscopic world

- emergent property of directionality of time, only in macroscopic world



- cause is an emergent property, high level

- just that humans haven't experienced future but did experience past

- at the macroscopic level can interpret as cause and effect
- a small change after whose sequence follows a big change
- due to directionality of time

- on high level can best describe world using those concepts
