# Relativity


- four dimensional spacetime


- can orient my axes arbitrarily
- space and time relative, not same for everyone, knew already for space, harder to grasp for time
- could call part of your space direction my time direction

- also my axes can appear to be bend for you due to me being close to gravitating object

- always moves with constant speed of light through spacetime (not necessarily space!)
- the more through space the less through time, the less through space the more through time

- everything only matter of perspective, nothing fundamental

- can't move freely through time, can't go back and forth, see Time
- ?? space is bend around time, can only move in cone



## Consequences

- e.g. apple falls because it's time direction is bending into my space direction, apple sees itself as stationary in space
- simultaneity is relative

- time dilation, time of others seem to me slower
- beware: meadow analogy breaks down, looks as if goes faster ❗️
