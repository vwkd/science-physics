# Relativity


- four dimensional spacetime

- applies principle if relativity to 4D space

- can orient my axes arbitrarily
- space and time is relative, not absolute
- knew already for space, harder to grasp for time
- (part of) your space direction could be my time direction

- also my axes can appear to be bend for you due to me being close to gravitating object

- always moves with constant speed of light through spacetime (not necessarily space!)
- the more through space the less through time, the less through space the more through time

- always moves on straight line through bend spacetime
?? but bend spacetime itself makes it seem deflected

- everything only matter of perspective, nothing fundamental

- can't move freely through time, can't go back and forth, see Time
- ?? space is bend around time, can only move in cone



## Consequences

- e.g. apple falls because it's time direction is bending into my space direction, apple sees itself as stationary in space
- simultaneity is relative

- time dilation, time of others seem to me slower￼
- beware: meadow analogy breaks down, looks as if goes faster ❗️
- length contraction
?? since time at back in future and at front in past

- gravity is illusion, 

- mass curves spacetime, distort
surface of massive object constantly accelerates outwards, constantly grows

- curvature progresses through spacetime at speed of light, gravitational waves
