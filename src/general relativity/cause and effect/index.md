# Cause



## Introduction

in quantum mechanics (and previously classical mechanics) given current state, can compute future, but can also compute past
    determinism, no free will
future is not different from past
just that humans haven't experienced future but did experience past

at every point in time can compute all further and previous points in time
like a sequence of integers, 3 is not caused by 2 and is not the cause for 4, it's just a pattern

laws of physics are the pattern
there is no cause and effect

at the macroscopic level can interpret as cause and effect
a small change after whose sequence follows a big change
due to arrow of time
