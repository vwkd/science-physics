# Phase Space



## Introduction

- set of all possible states of a system
- a state corresponds to a unique point in this abstract phase space
- allows to translate a problem from dynamics into geometry where can potentially be solved more easily
- example: system of two colliding ideal blocks, the (velocity) phase space is the space with the velocities of the blocks as axes
- more generally, for each degree of freedom or parameter there is an axis.
