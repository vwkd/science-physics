# Introduction



## Introduction

- phase space: space of all possible states of a system, e.g. for particle in 1D one needs position and velocity to predict future state so phase space is 2D (position, velocity).
- state: everything you need to know to fully characterise a system / predict what happens next



## Principles of CM

- every classical system is deterministic into both the past & future, i.e. if you know the state of the system in one instant of time you can completely predict all its future & past states. (time reversible?)
- can be seen as information conservation
- most fundamental law of physics (experimental fact): information is conserved
