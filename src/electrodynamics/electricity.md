# Electricity



## Conductor

- material that allows the flow of charge carriers, e.g. metal
- charge carriers depend on material, e.g. in most metals are electrons, in electrolyte are ions, etc.
- charge carriers moves from one atom to next, pushes next charge, like domino (Drude model)
- velocity of charge is close to speed of light (signal)
- velocity of charge carriers is much lower (drift velocity)



## Resistance

- ratio of voltage (accross material) to current (through material)
- quantity for material's opposition to current, for given current needs more / less pushing force or for given pushing force gets less / more current
- depends on material and shape
- unit: Ohm `Ω = V/A`
- charge carriers bounce against atoms and get deflected (Drude model)
- ohmic / linear material: material for which resistance is constant for varying voltages and currents, i.e. voltage and current are proportional
- beware: ohmic material is idealisation, every material in nonohmic eventually for high voltages or currents ⚠️
- beware: there is no Ohm's "law", was an empirical observation of ohmic materials ⚠️
- conductance: reciprocal of resistance
- resistivity: resistance but shape-independent, depends only on material
- conductivity: reciprocal of resistivity
- resistor: material that has resistance, every material has some resistance even conductors, except superconductors
- resistor consumes energy since reduces current flow, dissipates energy as heat



## Applications

### Incandescence

- emission of light from a material due to its temperature
- light bulb: current through wire makes it get hot because of resistance, very inefficient since <5% of supplied energy becomes light and rest is lost to heat

### Electroluminescence

- emission of light from a material due to recombination of electrons & holes
- LED: current through semiconductors creates recombination of electrons & holes, much more efficient than light bulbs, less heat, longer lifetime
