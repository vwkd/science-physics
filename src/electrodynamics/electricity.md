# Electricity



## Introduction

- set of physial phenomena of electrical charges
- can think of water
- beware: often used as synonym for the phenomena it consists of, e.g. "create electricity", "electricity flows", "using electricity", etc. ❗️



## Charge

- what flows
- like water amount, liter $\text{l}$
- fundamental property of subatomic particles, like mass, length, etc.
- responsible for electric force, similar to how mass is responsible for gravitational force
- two kinds of charges, positive and negative, unlike mass where there is only one kind of mass
- protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged
- electrons and protons have same magnitute of charge, called elementary charge, smallest amount of charge
- like charges repel each other, opposite charges attract each other, unlike gravitational force which is always attractive
- unit: Coulomb $\text{C}$



## Conductor

- material that allows the flow of charge carriers, e.g. metal
- charge carriers depend on material, e.g. in most metals are electrons, in electrolyte are ions, etc.
- charge carriers moves from one atom to next, pushes next charge, like domino (Drude model)
- velocity of charge is close to speed of light (signal)
- velocity of charge carriers is much lower (drift velocity)



## Current

- how much charge flows
- like water flow rate, e.g. $\text{l}/\text{s}$
- needs voltage
- flow rate of charge across a surface, amount of charge that flows by surface per unit time
- unit: Ampere $\text{A} = \text{C}/\text{s}$
- beware: often uses as synonym for charge, e.g. "current is flowing" ❗️
- conventional current direction (technische Stromrichtung): direction that positive charge carriers flow, independent of what the actual charge carriers are
- real current direction (physikalische Stromrichtung): direction that actual charge carriers flow, dependent on what charge carriers are
- beware: also used for flow itself, set of all moving charge carriers ❗️



## Voltage (between two points)

- what makes charge flow
- like water pressure, Pascals $\text{P} = \text{N}/\text{m}^2$
- creates current
- difference in potential between the two points, work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points, energy transfered between two points
- choice of reference point is irrelevant since taking the difference cancels it out
- unit: Volt $\text{V} = \text{J}/\text{C}$
- beware: don't confuse unit Volt $V$ with quantity voltage $V$ ❗️
- negative charge is pulled towards higher voltages, positive charge is pulled towards lower voltages, i.e. in conventional current direction current flows from higher voltage to lower voltage
- voltage "at a point" implicitly sets the other point to be ground ❗️



## Circuit

- a closed path where current can flow around
- current is inherent property of circuit, not of external charges
- voltage is not inherent property of circuit, created outside by external charges (in some black box energy source, e.g. battery)
- can not have current if circuit is not closed, can have voltage if circuit is not closed
- in typical metal circuit, charge carriers are electrons, therefore conventional current direction is $+$ to $-$ while real current direction is $-$ to $+$
- by definition alone voltage and current are not related, can have high voltage and low current, or high current and low voltage, only related by components of circuit ❗️



## Resistance

- ratio of voltage (accross material) to current (through material)
- quantity for material's opposition to current, for given current needs more / less pushing force or for given pushing force gets less / more current
- depends on material and shape
- unit: Ohm $\text{Ω} = \text{V}/\text{A}$
- charge carriers bounce against atoms and get deflected (Drude model)
- ohmic / linear material: material for which resistance is constant for varying voltages and currents, i.e. voltage and current are proportional
- beware: ohmic material is idealisation, every material in nonohmic eventually for high voltages or currents ⚠️
- beware: there is no Ohm's "law", was an empirical observation of ohmic materials ⚠️
- conductance: reciprocal of resistance
- resistivity: resistance but shape-independent, depends only on material
- conductivity: reciprocal of resistivity
- resistor: material that has resistance, every material has some resistance even conductors, except superconductors
- resistor consumes energy since reduces current flow, dissipates energy as heat



## Applications

### Incandescence

- emission of light from a material due to its temperature
- light bulb: current through wire makes it get hot because of resistance, very inefficient since <5% of supplied energy becomes light and rest is lost to heat

### Electroluminescence

- emission of light from a material due to recombination of electrons & holes
- LED: current through semiconductors creates recombination of electrons & holes, much more efficient than light bulbs, less heat, longer lifetime
