# Electricity



## Introduction

- set of physial phenomena of electrical charges
- often used as synonym for the phenomena it consists of, e.g. "create electricity", "electricity flows", "using electricity", etc.



## Charge

- fundamental property of subatomic particles, like mass, length, etc.
- responsible for electric force, similar to how mass is responsible for gravitational force
- two kinds of charges, positive and negative, unlike mass where there is only one kind of mass
- protons are positively charged, electrons are negatively charged
- electrons and protons have same magnitute of charge, called elementary charge, smallest amount of charge
- like charges repel each other, opposite charges attract each other, unlike gravitational force which is always attractive
- unit: Coulomb `C`



## Conductor

- material that allows the flow of charge carriers, e.g. metal
- charge carriers depend on material, e.g. in most metals are electrons, in electrolyte are ions, etc.
- charge carriers moves from one atom to next, pushes next charge, like domino (Drude model)
- velocity of charge is close to speed of light (signal)
- velocity of charge carriers is much lower (drift velocity)



## Current

- rate of flow of charge past a point, amount of charge that flows by per unit time
- unit: Ampere `C/s`
- often uses as synonym for charge, e.g. "current is flowing"
- technischen Stromrichtung: direction that positive charges would flow, independent of what the actual charge carriers are, i.e. `+` to `-` in circuit
- physikalische Stromrichtung: direction that charge carriers flow, dependent of what actual charge carriers are, i.e. if electrons then `-` to `+` in circuit



## Voltage (between two points)

- difference in potential between the two points, work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points
- choice of reference point is irrelevant since taking the difference cancels it out
- unit: Volt `J/C`
- negative charge is pulled towards higher voltages, positive charge is pulled towards lower voltages, i.e. in technische Stromrichtung current flows from higher voltage to lower voltage



## Circuit

- a closed path around which a current can flow
- current is inherent property of circuit, not of external charges
- voltage is not inherent property of circuit, created outside by external charges (in some black box energy source, e.g. battery)
- can not have current if circuit is not closed, can have voltage if circuit is not closed



## Water analogy

- charge: water element
- current: water flow rate, e.g. 1l of water flows by in this tube per second
- voltage: water pressure, pushes water in one direction, makes water do work, e.g. spin a turbine
- charge is what flows, voltage is what makes it flow, current is how much of it flows



## Resistance

- ratio of voltage (accross material) to current (through material)
- quantity for material's opposition to current, for given current needs more / less pushing force or for given pushing force gets less / more current
- depends on material and shape
- unit: Ohm `Ω = V/A`
- charge carriers bounce against atoms and get deflected (Drude model)
- ohmic / linear material: material for which resistance is constant for varying voltages and currents, i.e. voltage and current are proportional
- beware: ohmic material is idealisation, every material in nonohmic eventually for high voltages or currents ⚠️
- beware: there is no Ohm's "law", was an empirical observation of ohmic materials ⚠️
- conductance: reciprocal of resistance
- resistivity: resistance but shape-independent, depends only on material
- conductivity: reciprocal of resistivity
- resistor: material that has resistance, every material has some resistance even conductors, except superconductors
- resistor consumes energy since reduces current flow, dissipates energy as heat



## Applications

### Incandescence

- emission of light from a material due to its temperature
- light bulb: current through wire makes it get hot because of resistance, very inefficient since <5% of supplied energy becomes light and rest is lost to heat

### Electroluminescence

- emission of light from a material due to recombination of electrons & holes
- LED: current through semiconductors creates recombination of electrons & holes, much more efficient than light bulbs, less heat, longer lifetime
