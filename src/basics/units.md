# Units



## Quantity (Quantität)

- amount
- expressed as number



## Quantification (Quantifizierung)

- determination of the quantity
- can think of a counting



## Physical quantity (Physikalische Größe)

- quantifiable property of a system, e.g. length, mass, time, electric current, etc.
- value of physical quantity (Größenwert) can be expressed as product of numerical value / numerical magnitude (Zahlenwert) an unit (Einheit)
- symbol is cursive serif lower case letter, e.g. $\emph{l}$ for length
- beware: term "quantity" is overloaded in English ❗️
- (base) properties of system rely on intuition, can't be further defined from constituents, e.g. no answer to "What is length?", "What is time?", etc.
- quantification of property relies on intuition, e.g. no answer to "What is a value of length?", "What is a value of time?", etc.
- quantity provides context to numerical value, e.g. "a length of 5" refers to a numerical value for the property "length" of the system (which then relies on intuition)



## Unit (Einheit)

- a standard value of a physical quantity (Vergleichsgrößenwert)
- other values of same physical quantity are expressed as multiples of it
- a scale, a multiplication factor
- can choose any value of the physical quantity as unit
- symbol is sans-serif lower case letter, e.g. $m$ for meter
- beware: the unit itself doesn't give the numerical value any context, but since units are unique to physical quantity, the physical quantity can be implicitly inferred, e.g. the unit "m" in "5 m" doesn't give meaning to "5" but it infers the physical quantity "length" which gives meaning to "5"



## Dimension

- set of all units of a physical quantity
- same name as physical quantity, e.g. length, mass, time, electric current, etc.
- beware: don't confuse with physical quantity itself ❗️
- symbol is same letter as physical quantity in sans-serif upper case, e.g. $L$ for physical quantity $\emph{l}$



## Base quantity (Basisgröße)

- physical quantity that can't be expressed using other base quantities
- like a basis vector in the vector space of "physical quantities"



## Quantity system (Größensystem)

- a set of base quantities, e.g. International System of Quantities (ISQ)
- choice of base quantities is convention
- like a basis of the vector space of "physical quantities"
- like the axioms of the system
- derived quantity: other quantity expressed using base quantities



## Base unit (Basiseinheit)

- a unit for a base quantity
- like a basis vector in the vector space of "dimensions of base quantities"



## Unit system (Einheitensystem)

- a set of units for the base quantities of the quantity system, e.g. International System of Units (SI) for ISQ
- choice of base units is convention
- like a basis of the vector space of "dimensions of base quantities"
