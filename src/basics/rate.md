# Rate



## Introduction

- ratio of two quantities
- can think of as change in nominator quantity over denominator quantity
- can be dimensionful or dimensionless
- can be temporal or non-temporal
- also called rate of change, derivative, etc.
- note: almost everything is a rate!
- beware: calls plot of all ratios over all values of denominator quantity still same name!
- if thinks of nominator quantity as cumulative, can think of increase or decrease
- if increase also called growth, rate of growth, growth rate
- if decrease also called decay, rate of decay, decay rate
- e.g. eating speed is 5g/s or stomach content growth rate is 5g/s



## Dimensionless

- rate where same quantity in nominator and denominator
- expressed as count or percentage
- e.g. tax rate, literacy rate, inflation, etc.



## Non-temporal

- rate where non-time in denominator quantity
- ratio of quantity over non-time quantity
- e.g. exchange rate, electric field, etc.



## Temporal

- rate where time in denominator quantity
- often called speed, frequency, etc.
- e.g. speed, acceleration, power, heart rate, flux, bit rate, radioactive decay, etc.
