# Dimension



- direction
- straight, not bend
- independent, can go in one direction without going in others, is smallest number of directions to go in any direction



## Perception

- sees one dimension less, e.g. in 3D sphere looks like circle (ignoring shadows)
- infers last dimension through projection due to size, distorted angles, shadow, e.g. smaller size is distance
- from higher dimension can see inside objects in lower dimension, can observe everything from outside without touching it, e.g. in 3D can see inside circle
- higher dimensional object can dis/appear into/out of thin air in lower dimension, since can move away into additional dimension
- in lower dimension can see only cross section of higher dimensional object, e.g. in 2D sees plane of 3D object
- in 1D sees point
- in 2D sees line, like horizon of ocean
- in 3D sees plane, like painting on image
