# Dimension



- direction
- straight, not bend
- independent, can go in one direction without going in others, is smallest number of directions to go in any direction



## Perception

- sees one dimension less, e.g. in 3D sphere looks like circle (ignoring shadows)
- infers missing dimension because of perspective, size, distortion, shadow, e.g. smaller size is distanct
- from higher dimension can see inside objects in lower dimension, e.g. in 3D can see inside circle
- in 1D sees point (without radius)
- in 2D sees line, like horizon of ocean
- in 3D sees plane, like painting on image
