# Atmospheric pressure



## Introduction

- pressure from weight of atmosphere
- approximately weight of air column above due to gravity
- also called air pressure, barometric pressure
- decreases with elevation, since less air above
- varies with temperature, wind, composition, etc.



## Reference

- where is zero?

### Standard pressure

- at mean sea level
- on average 101,325 Pa, calls 1 atmosphere [atm]



## Vertical gradient

- how fast does pressure decrease with altitude?
- about 1 hPa per 30 ft, more above 6000 ft above mean sea level
- varies with temperature
- also called pressure lapse rate

### Lower temperature

- pressure decreases faster with altitude, since
- air molecules move less, so air is more dense
- the amount of air molecules in an air column is roughly constant, so the air column gets shorter, more compacted
- climbing to a given altitude passes more air molecules, so there's less air molecules remaining above
- hence higher vertical gradient
- can think of steeper hill, must walk less to reach a given level

### Higher temperature

- pressure decreases slower with altitude, since
- air molecules move more, so air is less dense
- the amount of air molecules in an air column is roughly constant, so the air column gets taller, less compacted
- climbing to a given altitude passes less air molecules, so there's more air molecules remaining above
- hence lower vertical gradient
- can think of shallower hill, must walk further to reach a given level
